In October 2025, as part of a homework assigment for a statics course, I had to design a lever arm mechanism to lift the highest possible weight and to raise it to the highest possible height. The 2D design space was 150cm long by 50cm high.

### Choosing the Actuator     

I had to choose from a catalog of online actuators. Since I wanted to maximize the weight lifted, chose the actuator which could provide the greatest force output. I chose from the [Tolomatic Online Catalog](https://www.tolomatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2700-4000_29_IMA_cat.pdf). I chose the RSX Electric Rod Style Actuator, which provided a really great force output of 294kN.

### Mathematical Model

Let bar length be L, angle θ above horizontal, and load W at the tip.  
The actuator attaches to the bar at distance a from the pivot, making angle α  
relative to the bar (angle between actuator’s line of action and bar).

Doing an equilibrium anaylsis yields the following equations and relationships:

### Finalizing the Design

To finalize:

* I decided that the max height lifted would be the height of the design space (so 50cm!).
* The actuator would be at 90 degrees to the ground.
* The max weight could be supported when the actuator was at 150cm from the start.
    * The max weight was 294kN.
    * This was equal to the force the actuator could provide.
