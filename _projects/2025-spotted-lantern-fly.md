In November 2025, as part of a homework for a thermodynamics class I had to analyze a real thermodynamic system and consider ways to improve it.

### The Model of the Engine

A piston-cylinder engine is a mechanical system that converts energy from a working fluid into reciprocating motion. It consists of a cylindrical chamber in which the piston moves back and forth (up and down) as pressure within the cylinder changes. In this analysis, the engine is modelled as an **Otto Cycle**, which consists of the following steps:

- **1 → 2:** Isentropic compression  
- **2 → 3:** Constant-volume heat addition  
- **3 → 4:** Isentropic expansion  
- **4 → 1:** Constant-volume heat rejection  

In this ideal case, all processes are assumed to be internally reversible, and there is no heat transfer between the system and the surroundings.

### Work and Heat for Each Process

The net work of the cycle is obtained by subtracting the work input during process **1 → 2** from the work output during process **3 → 4**. The net work can also be evaluated as the net heat added, which is found by subtracting the heat rejected during process **4 → 1** from the heat added during process **2 → 3**. Therefore, the area enclosed by both the **p–v diagram** and the **T–s diagram** represents the net work output of the ideal **Otto Cycle**.

Since air is assumed to behave as an ideal gas, the work and heat transfer for each process can be expressed in terms of the specific heat at constant volume. The work done or heat transferred during a process from state a → b is given by the specific heat at constant volume multiplied by the temperature difference between the two states.

## Mass Balance

### General control-volume form
dm_CV/dt = Σ ṁ_in − Σ ṁ_out

### For a piston engine
- Over a full cycle, the engine returns to its initial state
- Therefore, **no net mass accumulation**

Σ ṁ_in = Σ ṁ_out

## Energy Balance (First Law of Thermodynamics)

### General control-volume form
dE_CV/dt = Σ Q̇ − Σ Ẇ  
     + Σ ṁ_in (h + V²/2 + gz)_in  
     − Σ ṁ_out (h + V²/2 + gz)_out

### For a piston engine (simplifications)
- Changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible
- Over a cycle:

dE_CV/dt = 0

Σ Q̇ − Σ Ẇ + Σ ṁ_in h_in − Σ ṁ_out h_out = 0

- This balance governs **engine efficiency and power output**

---

## Entropy Balance (Second Law of Thermodynamics)

### General control-volume form
dS_CV/dt = Σ (Q̇_k / T_k)  
     + Σ ṁ_in s_in  
     − Σ ṁ_out s_out  
     + S_gen

- **Note:** S_gen ≥ 0

### For a piston engine (steady cyclic operation)
Σ (Q̇_k / T_k) + Σ ṁ_in s_in − Σ ṁ_out s_out + S_gen = 0

- The entropy balance quantifies **irreversibility and efficiency limits**

## Design or Operating Condition Improvement

One potential improvement to the piston–cylinder engine is increasing the *compression ratio* of the Otto cycle. This change can be achieved through a design modification that reduces the clearance volume at top dead center while keeping the displacement volume fixed.

Increasing the compression ratio raises the temperature and pressure at the end of the isentropic compression process (state 2). As a result, for the same amount of heat added during the constant-volume heat addition process, a greater fraction of the input heat is converted into useful work during the expansion process. From a thermodynamic standpoint, this leads to an increase in the *thermal efficiency* of the cycle, as predicted by the ideal Otto cycle efficiency relation.

However, higher compression ratios also increase peak cylinder temperatures and pressures, which can introduce practical limitations such as material stress, heat transfer losses, and the risk of engine knock in real engines. Therefore, while increasing the compression ratio improves ideal cycle performance, it must be balanced against mechanical and thermal constraints in real system design.

We did this project in a group and the people in my group were Teddy Rauchway and Panashe Neghna.
