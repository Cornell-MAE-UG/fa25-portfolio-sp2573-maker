My name is Sanithu Mohottige, and I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am and have always been intereseted in the field. I built LEGO sets when I was really young, built robots at school, tand worked on side projects by myself.

I love the applied physics and math part of mechanical engineering and really enjoy learning and studying the subject. I have taken, or am currently taking the following coursework:
* Single and Multivariable Calculus
* Statics and Mechanics of Materials
* Thermodynamics
* Differential Equations
* Electricity and Magnetism
